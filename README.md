The project addresses the following topics:<br />
- User management, including managing logins, sessions, user roles, profiles and user avatars. Note that I implemented my own login system rather than Miguel's OpenID system. <br />
- Database management, including migration handling.<br />
- Web form support, including field validation.<br />
- HTML templates.<br />
